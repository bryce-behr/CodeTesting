I edited the StatsFile class, I added 2 static methods for the writing to CSV, because they felt better there

things to do by file
ComputerGuessesPanel: DONE
GameOverPanel: DONE
GameResult/GameStats: CAN edit
GuessResult: CAN'T edit
GuessTheNumberUI: DONE
HumanGuessesGame: CAN edit
HumanGuessesPanel/ScreenID: CAN'T edit
StatsFile: doesn't say if we can/can't edit, I did anyway
StatsPanel: {
    Refactor the whole class
}
